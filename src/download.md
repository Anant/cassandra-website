Downloading Cassandra
---------------------

### Latest version

Cassandra is moving to a monthly release process called Tick-Tock. **Even-numbered** releases (e.g. 3.2) contain new
features; **odd-numbered** releases (e.g. 3.3) contain bug fixes only. If a critical bug is found, a patch will be
released against the most recent bug fix release. Read more about [tick-tock here](http://www.planetcassandra.org/blog/cassandra-2-2-3-0-and-beyond/).

Download the latest Cassandra release: {{ "latest" | full_release_link }}.

### Older supported releases

The following older Cassandra releases are still supported:

* Apache Cassandra 3.0 is supported until **6 months after 4.0 release (date TBD)**. The latest release is {{ "3.0" | full_release_link }}.
* Apache Cassandra 2.2 is supported until **4.0 release (date TBD)**. The latest release is {{ "2.2" | full_release_link }}.
* Apache Cassandra 2.1 is supported until **4.0 release (date TBD)** with **critical fixes only**. The latest release is
  {{ "2.1" | full_release_link }}.

Older (unsupported) versions of Cassandra are [archived here](http://archive.apache.org/dist/cassandra/).

### Installation from Debian packages

* For tick-tock releases, the `<release series>` is the release number, without dot, and with an appended `x`, so `31x`,
  `32x`, â€¦
* For older pre-tick-tock releases, the `<release series>` is the major version number, without dot, and with an
  appended `x`. So currently it can one of `21x`, `22x` or `30x`.

* Add the Apache repository of Cassandra to `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list`, for example for version 3.9:

```
echo "deb http://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/debian 39x main" | sudo tee -a /etc/apt/sources.list.d/cassandra.sources.list
```

* Add the Apache Cassandra repository keys:

```
curl https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS | sudo apt-key add -
```

* Update the repositories:

```
sudo apt-get update
```

* If you encounter this error:

```
GPG error: http://www.apache.org 39x InRelease: The following signatures couldn't be verified because the public key is not available: NO_PUBKEY A278B781FE4B2BDA
```
Then add the public key A278B781FE4B2BDA as follows:

```
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-key A278B781FE4B2BDA
```
and repeat `sudo apt-get update`. The actual key may be different, you get it from the error message itself. For a
full list of Apache contributors public keys, you can refer to <https://www.apache.org/dist/cassandra/KEYS>.

* Install Cassandra:

```
sudo apt-get install cassandra
```

* You can start Cassandra with `sudo service cassandra start` and stop it with `sudo service cassandra stop`.
  However, normally the service will start automatically. For this reason be sure to stop it if you need to make any
  configuration changes.
* Verify that Cassandra is running by invoking `nodetool status` from the command line.
* The default location of configuration files is `/etc/cassandra`.
* The default location of log and data directories is `/var/log/cassandra/` and `/var/lib/cassandra`.
* Start-up options (heap size, etc) can be configured in `/etc/default/cassandra`.
